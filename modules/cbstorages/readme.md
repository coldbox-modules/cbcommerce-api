# WELCOME TO THE CBSTORAGES MODULE
A collection of model objects to facade and help with native ColdFusion persistence structures and also any Cache using CacheBox.  This can allow you to leverage distributed caches like Couchbase, Redis, ehCache, etc for distributed session management.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Lucee 4.5+
- ColdFusion 10+

# INSTRUCTIONS
Just drop into your **modules** folder or use CommandBox to install

`box install cbstorages`

## WireBox Mappings
The module registers the following storage mappings:

* `applicationStorage@cbstorages` - For application based storage
* `clientStorage@cbstorages` - For client based storage
* `cookieStorage@cbstorages` - For cookie based storage
* `clusterStorage@cbstorages` - For cluster based storage (Lucee only)
* `sessionStorage@cbstorages` - For session based storage
* `cacheStorage@cbstorages` - For CacheBox based storage simulating session/client
* `requestStorage@cbstorages` - For request based storage

You can check out the included API Docs to see all the functions you can use for persistence.

## Settings
Some storages require further configuration via your configuration file `config/ColdBox.cfc` under a `storages` structure:

```js
storages = {
    // Cache Storage Settings
    cacheStorage = {
        cachename   = "The CacheBox cache to use",
        timeout     = 60 // The default timeout of the session bucket, defaults to 60
    },

    // Cluster Storage Settings
    clusterStorage = {
        clusterAppName = "MyApp"
    },

    // Cookie Storage settings
    cookieStorage = {
        useEncryption   = false,
        encryptionSeed  = "CBStorages",
        encryptionAlgorithm = "CFMX_COMPAT",
        encryptionEncoding = "HEX"
    }
};
```

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the 
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5
